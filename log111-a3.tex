\section{}
\begin{proof}
  By construction, the set $\Gamma_{1} \cup \Gamma_{2}$ is unsatisfiable, so by compactness, there is a finite unsatisfiable subset $\Delta \subseteq \Gamma_{1} \cup \Gamma_{2}$.
  
  Consider
  \begin{align*}
    \Delta_{1} := \Delta \setminus \Gamma_{2} && \Delta_{2} := \Delta \setminus \Gamma_{1}.
  \end{align*}
  We claim that $\Delta_{1}$ and $\Delta_{2}$ respectively axiomatize $\Th(\Gamma_{1})$ and $\Th(\Gamma_{2})$.
  We prove that this is the case for $\Delta_{1}$; the argument for $\Delta_{2}$ is completely analogous.

  We need to prove that for any formula $\varphi$, $\Gamma_{1} \vdash \varphi$ iff $\Delta_{1} \vdash \varphi$.
  To this end, it suffices to prove their semantic counterpart by soundness and completeness.
  
  The if direction is an immediate consequence of monotonicity.
  In the other direction, suppose that $\Gamma_{1} \vDash \varphi$ and let $M \vDash \Delta_{1}$.
  If $M \vDash \Gamma_{1}$ then we are done.
  On the other hand, if $M \nvDash \Gamma_{1}$ then it follows that $M \vDash \Delta_{2}$, but this means that $M \vDash \Delta_{1} \cup \Delta_{2}$ contradicting the fact that $\Delta = \Delta_{1} \cup \Delta_{2}$ is unsatisfiable.
\end{proof}

  \end{mathpar}
  $\Gamma \vDash \varphi$ iff for every $(X,R)$, if $(X,R)$ satisfies every formula in $\Gamma$ then $(X,R)$ satisfies $\varphi$.
\item To prove soundness, we can do an induction on the height of the derivation tree.
  
  The base case is immediate.
  In the induction case, we do a case analysis on the last applied rule.
  When the last applied rule is $\text{RAA}_{1}$, the induction hypothesis yields $\Gamma,c_{x} \nless c_{y} \vDash \bot$.
  Thus, for any $(X,R)$ satisfying $\Gamma$, $(X,R)$ must satisfy $c_{x} < c_{y}$, i.e., $\Gamma \vDash c_{x} < c_{y}$.
\item 
  \begin{proof}
    We show that if $\Gamma$ is consistent then $\Gamma$ is satisfiable.
    First, $X \times X$ is countable because $X$ is, so the set of formulas is enumerable.
    It is sufficient to enumerate formulas of the form $c_{x} < c_{y}$ and their negation as we have no use for $\bot$.
    We write $c_{n_1} < c_{n_2}$ or $c_{n_1} \nless c_{n_2}$ for the $n$-th enumeration.

    Let $\Gamma$ be a consistent set of formulas.
    We extend $\Gamma$ as follows:
    \begin{mathpar}
      \Gamma^{*} = \bigcup\{\Gamma_{n} \mid n \in \N\}\and
      \Gamma_{0} = \Gamma\and
      \Gamma_{n+1} =
      \begin{cases}
        \Gamma_{n},c_{n_1} < c_{n_2} & \text{if the resulting set is consistent,}\\
        \Gamma_{n},c_{n_1} \nless c_{n_2} & \text{otherwise.}
      \end{cases}
    \end{mathpar}
    Show that it is consistent...

    We include $c_x \nless c_y$ because we want this example to work in the next sub-question.

    We are now ready to define a partial order:
    \[
      R = \{(x,y) \mid c_{x} < c_{y} \in \Gamma^{*}\}
    \]
    If $(x,x) \in R$, then by definition $c_{x} < c_{x} \in \Gamma^{*}$.
    But this means that $\Gamma^{*}$ is inconsistent as $\Gamma^* \vdash \bot$ using R.
    Thus, $R$ is irreflexive.
  \end{proof}
